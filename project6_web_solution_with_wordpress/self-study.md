## Self-Study Guide: Building Web Solutions with WordPress and Three-Tier Architecture

This comprehensive guide delves into building robust and efficient web solutions using WordPress as the content management system (CMS) and leveraging the advantages of a three-tier architecture.

### Understanding Three-Tier Architecture

The realm of web development demands a structured approach to ensure application scalability, maintainability, and performance. One of the most effective strategies for achieving this is through a three-tier architecture.

#### What is Three-Tier Architecture?

A three-tier architecture is a client-server software architecture that segregates an application into three distinct logical layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:** This layer handles the user interface (UI), where users interact with the application. In the context of WordPress, this comprises themes and front-end components.

2. **Application Layer:** Also known as the business logic layer, this layer processes user inputs, makes logical decisions, and performs calculations. In WordPress, plugins and custom code fall under this layer.

3. **Data Layer:** This layer is responsible for data storage and management. It interacts with the database to retrieve, store, and update data. For WordPress, this typically involves MySQL or MariaDB databases.

#### Benefits of Three-Tier Architecture

Implementing a three-tier architecture offers several advantages:

- **Scalability:** Each layer can be scaled independently based on demand. If your website experiences a surge in traffic, you can scale up the presentation layer (web server) without affecting the application logic or data layer.
- **Maintainability:** The separation of concerns allows for easier management and updates to each layer. Developers can focus on modifying specific functionalities without having to worry about impacting other parts of the application.
- **Security:** Sensitive data can be isolated in the data layer, enhancing security by restricting direct access attempts.
- **Flexibility:** Each layer can be developed and deployed independently, allowing for a more adaptable development process. This flexibility enables developers to choose the most suitable technologies for each layer.

### Setting Up and Deploying a Three-Tier Architecture with WordPress

Here's a step-by-step guide to deploying a dynamic WordPress application on AWS using a three-tier architecture:

**1. Setting Up the Presentation Layer**

The presentation layer will be hosted on an EC2 instance running a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).

**Steps:**

- **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
  - Go to the AWS Management Console.
  - Launch a new EC2 instance with an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
  - Configure security groups to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- **Install Web Server:**
  - SSH into the EC2 instance.
  - Install Apache or Nginx:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install httpd -y
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```
- **Download and Configure WordPress:**
  - Download WordPress:
    ```bash
    wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    ```
  - Extract the downloaded file:
    ```bash
    tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
    ```
  - Move WordPress files to the web server document root:
    ```bash
    sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www/html/
    ```
  - Set ownership and permissions for the WordPress directory:
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
    sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
    ```

**2. Configuring the Application Logic Layer**

The application logic layer will be hosted on a separate EC2 instance, which will handle the PHP processing.

**Steps:**

- **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
  - Launch another EC2 instance for the application logic layer.
- **Install PHP and Required Extensions:**
  - SSH into the instance and install PHP:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install php php-mysql -y
    ```
  - Restart the web server:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
- **Configure WordPress to Use the Application Server:**
  - Modify the `wp-config.php` file on the presentation layer server to point to the application server's IP address or hostname.

**3. Establishing the Data Layer**

The data layer will leverage Amazon RDS, a scalable and managed
