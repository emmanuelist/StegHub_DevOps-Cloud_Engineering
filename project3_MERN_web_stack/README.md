# MERN Stack To-Do Application

This repository contains a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application is hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS and uses MongoDB Atlas as the database. The project demonstrates a complete workflow for developing, deploying, and managing a modern web application, including the creation of backend APIs, and the frontend client to interact with them.

## Introduction

This project involves the creation of a simple To-Do list application using the MERN stack. It includes a backend built with Node.js and Express.js, a MongoDB database for data storage, and a React.js frontend for user interaction. The application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance and uses MongoDB Atlas for the database.

The main objective is to create a scalable, modern web application with RESTful APIs using a unified JavaScript stack. This project also demonstrates how to host the application using AWS services like EC2 and MongoDB Atlas.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **AWS Account** for creating and managing EC2 instances
- **MongoDB Atlas Account** for creating a cloud MongoDB database
- **SSH Client** for connecting to the EC2 instance

## Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Update the server**  
   SSH into your EC2 instance and run the following commands to update the server:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**  
   Install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

3. **Initialize the project**  
   Create a new project directory and initialize it with npm:

   ```bash
   mkdir Todo
   cd Todo
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Express.js**  
   Express.js will be used to create the server and handle API requests:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

5. **Create the `index.js` file**  
   This file contains the server code. Create it and add the following:

   ```js
   const express = require("express");
   require("dotenv").config();
   const app = express();
   const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
     res.header(
       "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
       "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept"
     );
     next();
   });

   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
     res.send("Welcome to Express");
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

6. **Install dotenv**  
   To manage environment variables, install the `dotenv` module:
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Create the React app**  
   Inside the `Todo` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Install `concurrently` and `nodemon` to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously:

   ```bash
   npm install concurrently --save-dev
   npm install nodemon --save-dev
   ```

3. **Modify `package.json` scripts**  
   Add the following scripts to your `package.json` to enable concurrent development:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node index.js",
     "start-watch": "nodemon index.js",
     "dev": "concurrently \"npm run start-watch\" \"cd client && npm start\""
   }
   ```

4. **Create React Components**  
   Inside the `client/src/components` directory, create `Input.js`, `ListTodo.js`, and `Todo.js` files.

   - **Input.js** handles adding new To-Do items.
   - **ListTodo.js** renders the list of tasks.
   - **Todo.js** combines the other two components and handles state management for the To-Do list.

## Testing the Backend

Before connecting the frontend, you can test the backend APIs using Postman or a similar tool. Create a POST request to add a new To-Do item, a GET request to fetch all items, and a DELETE request to remove an item.

### Sample Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/todos`
- **POST** `/api/todos`
- **DELETE** `/api/todos/:id`

## Running the Application

To run the full MERN stack application (backend + frontend), use the following command from the `Todo` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch both the backend server and the React frontend, allowing you to interact with the application from a browser.

## Application Features

1. **Create a Task**  
   Users can create a new To-Do task by entering the task description and clicking the "Add Todo" button.

2. **View Tasks**  
   All active tasks are displayed in a list on the homepage. Tasks can be clicked to mark them as complete.

3. **Delete a Task**  
   Users can delete a completed task from the list by clicking on it.

## AWS Configuration

### Launching an EC2 Instance

1. Go to the AWS Management Console and launch a new EC2 instance in the `us-east-1` region.
2. Select **Ubuntu** as the operating system and choose an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
3. Configure the security group to allow inbound traffic on ports **22** (SSH), **80** (HTTP), and **443** (HTTPS).

### Configuring Security Groups

Set up inbound rules to control access:

- **SSH (port 22):** Restrict access to your trusted IP addresses for security.
- **HTTP (port 80):** Allow web traffic from anywhere.
- **HTTPS (port 443):** Allow secure web traffic.

### SSH Access

Once your instance is running, you can connect to it via SSH:

```bash
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@<EC2-instance-public-IP>
```

## Deployment

1. **MongoDB Atlas Setup**  
   Create a free MongoDB cluster on MongoDB Atlas and obtain the connection URI. Add this URI to your `.env` file.

2. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in your root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

   ```env
   DB='mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
   ```

3. **Run the Application**  
   Start the server and frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to the public IP of your EC2 instance, followed by port 5000:
   ```url
   http://<EC2-public-IP>:5000
   ```
